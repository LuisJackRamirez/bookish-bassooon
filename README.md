Shell terminal written in C

This is a compilation of files that simulate a Linux command interpreter, including a shell script that compiles and executes the program. The code is free for anyone to use, as its main purpose is to help Operational System in developing similar applications.

To run this shell terminal, make sure you're working on Ubuntu 18.04. Clone the entire repository in the directory of your choice, and run the shell script. You should be able to see the prompt in which you can begin type the desired commands (commands using both input and output redirection is currently not supported).


I'm open to contributions! Feel free to contact me at luisjackramirez@gmail.com if you have any idea in your mind; you can see the planned TODO list in the repository.

Huge thanks to the developers of Valgrind, whose framework allowed me to fix memory issues throughout the project.
